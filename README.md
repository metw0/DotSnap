# DotSnap-CLI
A minimalistic utility for managing configuration backups (or dotfiles) written in Python. 
I stuck to KISS, so anyone can figure it out.

### ⚙️ How to install?
1. After cloning the repository, go to its folder:
   `cd <path_to_folder>`
   *(replace with your actual directory path)*

2. Run the setup script (it will create a ready-made .venv):
   `chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`  
   
The program is now ready to use!

### 📜 Configuration
Just edit config.toml, the hints are already in it.

---

### 🧷 Usage
1. Run the main file:
  `python main.py`

2. Next, you will be guided through an easy-to-understand menu, so o I don't see the point in writing about it here.
